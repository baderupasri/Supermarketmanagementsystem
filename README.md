The Supermarket Management System is a web-based application designed to provide users with an interactive platform for browsing, searching, and purchasing grocery and household items. The system showcases a digital catalog of products that includes essential details such as name, category, description, price, and product image. Users can search and filter items by various attributes, view detailed information about each product, and add selected items to a shopping cart. The application implements shopping cart functionality with the ability to adjust quantities, view totals, and proceed through a mock checkout process.
